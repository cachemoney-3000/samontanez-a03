* Create a program that determines the complexity of a given password based on these rules:
    * A very weak password contains only numbers and is fewer than eight characters.
    * A weak password contains only letters and is fewer than eight characters.
    * A strong password contains letters and at least one number and is at least eight characters.
    * A very strong password contains letters, numbers, and special characters and is at least eight characters.
    * If a password does not meet any of these rules, then report it as a password of unknown strength.
